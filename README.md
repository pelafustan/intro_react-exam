# React I

## Exam

### Context

We were asked to develop a React App that consumes an API from our choice. For this project, I decided to use [this Harry Potter API](https://hp-api.onremote.com/) to deal with.

### About 

The App is conformed, basically, by:
* A header.
* A left sider.
* The main content.

On the header, you can find a HP logo, a title, and the search bar. The search bar is quite simple: you put a query and then you can get a result, if there is a match for your query.

On the (left) sider you can find some filters. You can choose to reduce the number of element showed on the main view by selecting:
* One or more species.
* One or more houses.
* One or more ancestry.

Also, you can sort the presented data.

The main view is a collection of cards. At the bottom, you can choose how many cards should be displayed on each page. You can show 10, 20, 50 or 100 cards by each page.
